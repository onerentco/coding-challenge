# Angry Children 2

Bill Gates is on one of his philanthropic journeys to a village in Utopia. He has **N** packets of candies and would like to distribute one packet to each of the **K** children in the village (each packet may contain different number of candies). To avoid a fight between the children, he would like to pick **K** out of **N** packets such that the unfairness is minimized.

Suppose the **K** packets have (X1, X2, X3,....Xk) candies in them, where Xi denotes the number of candies in the **i**th packet, then we define unfairness as
![img](https://hr-filepicker.s3.amazonaws.com/angry-children-2-eq-1.png)
where *|a|* denotes the absolute value of a.

#### Input Format 
The first line contains an integer N. 
The second line contains an integer K. 
N lines follow each integer containing the candy in the ith packet.

#### Output Format 
A single integer which will be minimum unfairness.

#### Constraints 
```
2 ≤ N ≤ 105 
2 ≤ K ≤ N 
0 ≤ number of candies in each packet ≤ 109
```

Sample Input #00
```
[7, 3, 10, 100, 300, 200, 1000, 20, 30]
```

Sample Output #00

```
40
```

Explanation #00

Bill Gates will choose packets having 10, 20 and 30 candies. So unfairness will be |10-20| + |20-30| + |10-30| = 40. We can verify that it will be minimum in this way.

Sample Input #01

```
[10, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 20, 30, 40, 100, 200]
```

Sample Output #01
```
10
```

Explanation #01

Bill Gates will choose 4 packets having 1,2,3 and 4 candies. So, unfairness will be |1-2| + |1-3| + |1-4| + |2-3| + |2-4| + |3-4| = 10
